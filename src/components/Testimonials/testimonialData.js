    text: `I had the pleasure working with Carl the past three years from recruiting and now being a student athlete at CSULA. He demonstrates and
      excels on and off the field with his leadership. Carl has been a first-class teammate, but also one of the most committed players on the team.
      He will provide so much energy and positivity in a work environment. All required assignment and responsibilities are 100% accurate and if he is
      uncertain he will ask questions.`

    text: `Carl submitted code that showed clear logical thinking and attention to craft.
    When creativity was allowed, Carl showed ingenuity and a sense of humor. Reading his code was a joy (and reading computer code rarely is! )
    because it showed an extremely intelligent and playful mind at work.`

    text: `Mr. Solli showed extraordinary capabilities at being able to absorb the concepts being presented and to incorporate them into the
    coding skills we were covering. He very quickly established himself as one of the top performers in the incoming freshman class.
    The material and programs that he turned in for the Lab and Homework assignments went well beyond what was required and indicated
    the he was pursuing additional self-motivated study outside of the class room.`
